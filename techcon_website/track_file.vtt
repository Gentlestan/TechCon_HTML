Hi, my name is Stanley with a background in renewable energy and technology. My transition into software development was born out for a desire for continuous learning solving complex problem taking on more mentally challenging tasks and a desire or pursuit for global opportunities in trying to better my software development skills. I've built some personal projects and also taken some boot camps. One of the bootcom of interest to me is the scream fronted carrier part where I fully understood the basic or the skeletal structure of

00:00:40.000 --> 00:01:52.000
the web that is the HTML and how to make the web more beautiful and responsive that is the cascading stylesheet or the CSS and also the interactivity of the web that is JavaScript also JavaScript library that is react and a whole lot of other um software development tools as a continuous learner I'll also be joining the ALX backend career path in order to become a full stack developer and also trying to contribute my own quarter or to help those who are just starting. I al I'm also running a YouTube series where I

00:01:16.000 --> 00:02:14.000
teach the very basic um concept that from HTML to JavaScript. I am specialized in building responsive user friendly web applications with my diverse technical experience in both hardware and software and my analytical approach to development. This will help me take on project with unique perspective and offer seamless solutions with high user experience.
